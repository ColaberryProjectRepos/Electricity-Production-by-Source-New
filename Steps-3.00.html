<p class="MsoNormal">1. Finding a project with good dataset was the most
challenging task .</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2. I had difficulty working with a single-to-many data
modeling relationship. However, when I tried to convert the Country-Continent
data to CSV files not working as expected. So, I keep many to many relationship
CVS excel files.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p></p><p>3. Creating step-by-step gifs that meet the less than 5MB
criteria was a challenging and time-consuming task. To avoid using too many
gifs, I had to memorize the steps allowing me to move quickly from one step to
the next.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1267/3/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
